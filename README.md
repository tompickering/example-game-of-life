#Terminal-based 'Game of Life'
This is a minimalistic, curses-based implementation of Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). At the time of writing, the program is hard-coded to draw a couple of gliders along wih a Gosper glider gun; if the terminal isn't large enough to accommodate this then the program will exit, printing the reason to stderr.

##Note on 'example-' repositories
None of my repositories beginning with 'example-' are intended to be useful pieces of software - rather, they exist to illustrate fun and interesting principles in a complete context. The purpose is simply to show how these sorts of things can be acheived, such that others might be able to deepen their understanding of certain algorithms or the utilities and techniques used to implement them. As such, the files are very thoroughly commented, ocasionally with tangential information such as justifications for design decisions etc. By the same token, I wrote these small programs to develop my own understanding in the first place, so if you can offer any constructuve criticism of my code, or if there's anywhere that I've done anything horifically inefficiently and there is a much simpler and clearer way of writing something then please let me know or throw a pull request my way - it's always greatly appreciated!
